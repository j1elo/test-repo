            Hello @${issue.user.login} :wave:! Thanks a lot for reporting an
            issue after finding a bug.


            However, **your report doesn't follow the [issue template](https://github.com/j1elo/test-repo/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)**,
            so it is being automatically closed. We are really sorry for that,
            but we need all reports to follow the template, or else it won't be
            possible to understand and help with all issues.


            Please, create a new issue following the template, or reopen this
            same issue to edit and provide all required information.

  # Add the issue to the "Triage" Project Baord.
  add-to-triage:
    name: Add to Triage
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Run after "check-template", only if didn't close the issue.
    needs: check-template
    # if: ${{ github.event.issue.state == open }}
